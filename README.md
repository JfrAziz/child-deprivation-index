# From the Sky to the Ground: Mapping Child Deprivation via Satellite - Application in Java, Indonesia

**_"From the Sky to the Ground: Mapping Child Deprivation via Satellite"_** is a web story project that utilizes satellite imagery to map and analyze areas of child deprivation. This project has been honored as part of üéñÔ∏è The Shortlist for The PacificVis 2024 Visual Data Storytelling Contest (https://visstory.github.io/).

**The PacificVis 2024 Visual Data Storytelling Contest** aims to encourage students, researchers, and visualization practitioners to demonstrate the value of data visualization through compelling visual data stories. This contest celebrates the emerging data communication genre, including data storytelling, narrative visualizations, explanatory notebooks, and visual essays. The contest held in conjunction with IEEE PacificVis 2024 from April 23-26, 2024 at Keio University, Tokyo, Japan. (https://visstory.github.io/#about)

This project employs advanced satellite imagery analysis techniques to identify spots where children face deprivation in crucial aspects of their lives. By combining cutting-edge technology with data visualization, we aim to shed light on areas lacking essential resources such as education, healthcare, and social services for children.

## Background
Children face challenges in accessing healthcare, education, and protection, particularly those in rural or suburban areas where geographical, economic, and infrastructural disparities hinder access to quality services. Economic and social services constraints often prevent parents from meeting their children's needs, including adequate healthcare accessibility. Furthermore, access to economic infrastructure supporting families and their children in meeting basic needs remains insufficient. 

Currently, data on children's well-being in Indonesia is limited, especially concerning accessibility to basic needs and geographical conditions. Welfare data for children in Indonesia only reaches the administrative level, lacking focus in pinpointing regions where deprived children potentially reside.

Yogyakarta exhibits a stark contrast between its high Human Development Index (HDI) and its high poverty rate. Typically, a low HDI would correlate with low poverty rates, but this is not the case in Yogyakarta. This anomaly can be attributed to the fact that despite high levels of education and healthcare in Yogyakarta, there are still segments of the population that lack adequate access to quality education and healthcare services, including children, who are more at risk of experiencing this deprivation.

## Objective

Satellite imagery analysis presents a powerful tool for monitoring and addressing Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1), which aims to eradicate poverty in all its forms, including child poverty. By harnessing this technology, we can track and analyze child deprivation information at a granular level, down to a 1 km grid.

Our interactive web story is dedicated to showcasing various aspects of children's well-being, including access to education, healthcare, and economic services. As users scroll down the web page, users will embark on a journey through data visualization and storytelling, gaining insights into the challenges and opportunities facing children.

The web story incorporates storytelling elements, including narratives, a brief explanation of the methodology, and case studies in the focused area, providing context and humanizing the data. Through this approach, we aim to not only inform but also engage and empower the audience to take action towards improving children's welfare in Yogyakarta and beyond.

As a potential solution to monitor spatially deprived children, integrating multi-source satellite image data, geospatial data, and machine learning algorithms could serve as powerful tools. By making the data accessible and visually appealing, we hope to create a platform that fosters collaboration, advocacy, and informed decision-making to ensure the well-being of every child in the region.
